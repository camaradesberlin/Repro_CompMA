	abstract = {Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is achieved by repeated transient ischaemia of a distant organ/limb and is neuroprotective in experimental ischaemic stroke. However, the optimal time and methods of administration are unclear. Systematic review identified relevant preclinical studies; two authors independently extracted data on infarct volume, neurological deficit, RIC method (administration time, site, cycle number, length of limb occlusion (dose)), species and quality. Data were analysed using random effects models; results expressed as standardised mean difference (SMD). In 57 publications incorporating 99 experiments (1406 rats, 101 mice, 14 monkeys), RIC reduced lesion volume in transient (SMD À2.0; 95\% CI À2.38, À1.61; p {\textless} 0.00001) and permanent (SMD À1.54; 95\% CI À2.38, À1.61; p {\textless} 0.00001) focal models of ischaemia and improved neurological deficit (SMD À1.63; 95\% CI À1.97, À1.29, p {\textless} 0.00001). In metaregression, cycle length and number, dose and limb number did not interact with infarct volume, although country and physiological monitoring during anaesthesia did. In all studies, RIC was ineffective if the dose was {\textless}10 or !50 min. Median study quality was 7 (range 4–9/10); Egger’s test suggested publication bias (p {\textless} 0.001). RIC is most effective in experimental stroke using a dose between 10 and 45 min. Further studies using repeated dosing in animals with comorbidities are warranted.},

	abstract = {Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a promising neuroprotective therapy for ischemic stroke. Preclinical studies investigating RIC have shown RIC reduced infarct volume, but clinical trials have been equivocal. Therefore, the efficacy of RIC in reducing infarct volume and quality of current literature needs to be evaluated to identify knowledge gaps to support future clinical trials. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical literature involving RIC in rodent models of focal ischemia. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019145441). Eligibility criteria included rat or mice models of focal ischemia that received RIC to a limb either before, during, or after stroke. MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched from 1946 to August 2019. Risk of bias was assessed using the SYRCLE risk of bias tool along with construct validity. Seventytwo studies were included in the systematic review. RIC was shown to reduce infarct volume (SMD − 2.19; CI − 2.48 to − 1.91) when compared to stroke-only controls and no adverse events were reported with regard to RIC. Remote ischemic conditioning was shown to be most efficacious in males (SMD − 2.26; CI − 2.58 to − 1.94) and when delivered poststroke (SMD − 1.34; CI − 1.95 to − 0.73). A high risk of bias was present; thus, measures of efficacy may be exaggerated. A limitation is the poor methodological reporting of many studies, resulting in unclear construct validity. We identified several important, but under investigated topics including the efficacy of RIC in different stroke models, varied infarct sizes and location, and potential sex differences.},

	abstract = {Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) has well-established cardioprotective effects in preclinical studies and promising results in preclinical stroke research. Effective translation from preclinical studies to clinical trials has yet to be accomplished, perhaps because of the use of multiple applications of RIC (e.g., pre-, per-, or post-conditioning) in preclinical studies by both invasive and non-invasive protocols, some of which not clinically applicable. Our systematic review conformed to PRISMA guidelines and addressed differences in clinically relevant RIC applications and outcomes between preclinical and clinical studies. We retrieved a total of 30 studies (8 human; 22 animal) that met the inclusion criteria of testing clinically relevant procedures; namely, non-invasive and peror post-conditioning protocols. Per-conditioning was applied in 6 animal and 3 human studies, post-conditioning was applied in 16 animal and 5 human studies, and both conditioning methods were applied in 2 animal studies. Application of RIC varied between human and animal studies regarding initiation, duration, repetition, and number of limbs included. Study designs did not systematically apply blinding, randomization, or placebo controls. On only a few occasions did preclinical studies include animals with clinically relevant comorbidities. Clinical trials were challenged by not completing the intended number of RIC cycles or addressing this deﬁcit in the data analysis. Consistency and transferability of methods used for positive animal studies and subsequent human studies are essential for the optimal translation of results. Consensus on preclinical and clinical RIC procedures should be reached for a full understanding of the possible beneﬁcial effects of RIC treatment in stroke.},

	abstract = {Stroke is one of the main causes of neurological disability worldwide and the second cause of death in people over 65 years old, resulting in great economic and social burden. Ischemic stroke accounts for 85\% of total cases, and the approved therapies are based on re-establishment of blood flow, and do not directly target brain parenchyma. Thus, novel therapies are urgently needed. In this review, limb remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is revised and discussed as a potential therapy against ischemic stroke. The review targets both (i) fundamental research based on experimental models and (ii) clinical research based on clinical trials and human interventional studies with healthy volunteers. Moreover, it also presents two approaches concerning RIC mechanisms in stroke: (i) description of the underlying cerebral cellular and molecular mechanisms triggered by limb RIC that promote neuroprotection against stroke induced damage and (ii) the identification of signaling factors involved in inter-organ communication following RIC procedure. Limb to brain remote signaling can occur via circulating biochemical factors, immune cells, and/or stimulation of autonomic nervous system. In this review, these three hypotheses are explored in both humans and experimental models. Finally, the challenges involved in translating experimentally generated scientific knowledge to a clinical setting are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Cerebral ischemia and reperfusion initiate cellular events in brain that lead to neurological disability. Investigating these cellular events provides ample targets for developing new treatments. Despite considerable work, no such therapy has translated into successful stroke treatment. Among other issues—such as incomplete mechanistic knowledge and faulty clinical trial design—a key contributor to prior translational failures may be insufficient scientific rigor during preclinical assessment: nonblinded outcome assessment; missing randomization; inappropriate sample sizes; and preclinical assessments in young male animals that ignore relevant biological variables, such as age, sex, and relevant comorbid diseases. Promising results are rarely replicated in multiple laboratories. We sought to address some of these issues with rigorous assessment of candidate treatments across 6 independent research laboratories. The Stroke Preclinical Assessment Network (SPAN) implements state-of-the-art experimental design to test the hypothesis that rigorous preclinical assessment can successfully reduce or eliminate common sources of bias in choosing treatments for evaluation in clinical studies. SPAN is a randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded, multilaboratory trial using a multiarm multi-stage protocol to select one or more putative stroke treatments with an implied high likelihood of success in human clinical stroke trials. The first stage of SPAN implemented procedural standardization and experimental rigor. All participating research laboratories performed middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery adhering to a common protocol and rapidly enrolled 913 mice in the first of 4 planned stages with excellent protocol adherence, remarkable data completion and low rates of subject loss. SPAN stage 1 successfully implemented treatment masking, randomization, prerandomization inclusion/exclusion criteria, and blinded assessment to exclude bias. Our data suggest that a large, multilaboratory, preclinical assessment effort to reduce known sources of bias is feasible and practical. Subsequent SPAN stages will evaluate candidate treatments for potential success in future stroke clinical trials using aged animals and animals with comorbid conditions.},

	abstract = {Human diseases may be modeled in animals to allow preclinical assessment of putative new clinical interventions. Recent, highly publicized failures of large clinical trials called into question the rigor, design, and value of preclinical assessment. We established the Stroke Preclinical Assessment Network (SPAN) to design and implement a randomized, controlled, blinded, multi-laboratory trial for the rigorous assessment of candidate stroke treatments combined with intravascular thrombectomy. Efficacy and futility boundaries in a multi-arm multi-stage statistical design aimed to exclude from further study highly effective or futile interventions after each of four sequential stages. Six independent research laboratories performed a standard focal cerebral ischemic insult in five animal models that included equal numbers of males and females: young mice, young rats, aging mice, mice with diet-induced obesity, and spontaneously hypertensive rats. The laboratories adhered to a common protocol and efficiently enrolled 2615 animals with full data completion and comprehensive animal tracking. SPAN successfully implemented treatment masking, randomization, prerandomization inclusion and exclusion criteria, and blinded assessment of outcomes. The SPAN design and infrastructure provide an effective approach that could be used in similar preclinical, multi-laboratory studies in other disease areas and should help improve reproducibility in translational science.

            Editor’s summary
            Preclinical science faces a reproducibility crisis. This hampers clinical translation and has led to the call for more rigorous and unbiased preclinical trials. Here Lyden and colleagues present the outcome of a randomized and blinded preclinical trial to assess stroke interventions, conducted by the Stroke Preclinical Assessment Network. Two thousand six hundred fifteen mice and rats were enrolled across six research laboratories that adhered to standardized protocols. Using a multi-arm multi-stage design, the authors tested six treatment candidates in four stages comprising different rodent models of ischemic stroke. Interventions that did not meet statistical criteria were eliminated after each stage. Only one intervention, uric acid, exceeded the efficacy threshold at the last stage of the trial. These results show that standardized preclinical trials across multiple laboratories are feasible. —Daniela Neuhofer},
