## Introduction / Aim

<!--Introduce the study and describe which part(s) you are trying to replicate / reproduce and any relevant background information.-->

In 2020, Ripley et al published a preclinical systematic review on the neuroprotective effects of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) in rodent models of stroke. <!-- ref--> Part of a sequence of several reviews on RIC <!-- Hansen et al, Molly et al, Weir et al --> it was chosen as the most robust review by the authors of the current report to be compared with the effect estimate of RIC from the Stroke Preclinical Assessment Network (SPAN) 1.0 which test six neuroprotective strategies in a robust multiarm multistage design. Although it follows recommended steps of a robust systematic review of animal data, we wanted to investigate whether we could replicate their results based on their shared raw data. So, our aim was to computationally replicate their primary endpoint as well as all subgroup analyses.
