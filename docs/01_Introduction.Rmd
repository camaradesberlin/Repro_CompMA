In 2021, Ripley et al. published a preclinical systematic review and meta-analysis on the neuroprotective effects of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) in rodent models of stroke [@ripley_2021]. Part of a sequence of several reviews on RIC [@hansen_2021; @mollet_2022; @weir_2021], it was chosen by the authors of the current report as the most robust review  to be compared with the effect estimate of RIC from the Stroke Preclinical Assessment Network 1.0 [@lyden_2022; @lyden_2023], which tested six neuroprotective strategies in a robust multiarm multistage design. Even though the study follows the recommended steps of a robust systematic review of animal data (as assessed by us? AMSTAR/ROBIS?), we aimed to investigate whether we could replicate their results based on their shared raw data. Therefore, our goal was to computationally reproduce their meta-analysis process and replicate their primary endpoint as well as all subgroup analyses.
